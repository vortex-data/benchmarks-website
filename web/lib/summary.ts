/**
 * Per-group summary rollups.
 *
 * Each `collect*Summary` runs focused SQL queries and returns one [`Summary`]
 * variant. Compression summaries compare the configured formats with Parquet.
 *
 * **Every group kind has a summary.** There is no allowlist gate: a benchmark
 * suite that lands in one of the five fact tables gets a rollup card the moment
 * its first rows are ingested. The timing-shaped families (query, random
 * access, vector search) all rank through the one [`rankSeries`] model below,
 * so a new suite in any of them needs no summary code at all. Adding a sixth
 * fact table is the only case that needs a new arm here, and
 * [`collectGroupSummary`]'s exhaustive switch makes omitting it a compile
 * error rather than a silently missing card.
 *
 * Behaviour-preservation notes (substrate migration, DuckDB -> Postgres):
 *  - Nullable-dim equality (`dataset_variant` / `scale_factor`) in the
 *    query-group summary is rendered as `col IS NULL` / `col = $n` per the
 *    concrete key's build-time value, the index-sargable form of the DuckDB
 *    `NULL == NULL` semantics (the same rule as `sargableDimEq` in
 *    `queries.ts`; PR-5.1.5). The compression summaries' self-joins below are
 *    the only remaining `IS NOT DISTINCT FROM` users -- there the dim is a
 *    join column, not a build-time constant, and the tables are small.
 *  - value columns are read `::float8` so node-postgres returns a JS `number`
 *    matching the Rust `CAST(... AS DOUBLE)`, rather than the bigint-as-string
 *    default.
 *  - the "latest timestamp" two-step (find the newest commit with a complete
 *    vortex/parquet pair, then aggregate at that timestamp) is preserved, but
 *    resolved entirely inside SQL via a CTE so `MAX(timestamp)` never round-trips
 *    through text. The Rust source rendered it via `CAST(MAX(ts) AS VARCHAR)` /
 *    `CAST(? AS TIMESTAMPTZ)`; DuckDB's VARCHAR cast preserves microseconds, but
 *    a text round-trip is fragile (a second-granularity render silently drops
 *    any sub-second commit timestamp), so the port keeps the timestamp in SQL.

 *
 *  - **Every bucket counts.** Ranking on one bucket's absolute times (which is
 *    what the random-access summary used to do -- it took whichever chart
 *    sorted first and quoted its raw numbers) states a group-wide conclusion
 *    from a single chart. `lance` leading `feature-vectors/correlated` says
 *    nothing about `nested-structs/uniform`.
 *  - **A missing bucket is not a free win.** A series measured on only the
 *    buckets it happens to win would otherwise outrank one measured
 *    everywhere. Where a series has no value the bucket contributes
 *    `max(itsWorstBucket, penaltyFloorNs) * 2` instead. `measured`/`total` on
 *    each row reports how much of the score was imputed.
 *
 * The `(10 + value) / (10 + best)` ratio (rather than `value / best`) is v2's,
 * damping sub-10ns noise; it is preserved because the shipped query scores are
 * pinned to it. Random-access and vector-search summaries also set a 2x floor
 * for a missing bucket. The floor prevents a penalty derived from a fast bucket
 * from beating a real measurement on a slower bucket. Query summaries keep a
 * zero floor to preserve the shipped v2 scores.

 *  - It does not pin every format to one global latest commit. `format` is
 *    ranked from its own newest run per chart, the same freshness policy the
 *    compression summaries apply to intermittently benchmarked formats such as
 *    `lance`: a format that skipped the newest commit is compared as of when it

  // "Latest per series" is a recursive-CTE skip scan (loose index scan) over the
  // covering index `idx_query_measurements_summary` (dataset, dataset_variant,
  // scale_factor, storage, query_idx, engine, format, commit_timestamp DESC)
  // INCLUDE (value_ns) from migrations 006/007 (PR-5.1.5 fix c). Those
  // migrations' in-file rationale describes the interim `DISTINCT ON` consumer
  // and predates the cold-render decision that shipped this skip scan; the
  // files are frozen post-apply, so this comment (and migrations/README.md) is
  // the current record. The previous
  // `DISTINCT ON (query_idx, engine, format) ... ORDER BY commit_timestamp DESC
  // NULLS LAST` form scanned the group's entire history (~1.8M index entries,
  // ~2.4s warm for tpcds at the prod seed); the skip scan instead does one
  // O(log n) index descent per distinct series tuple plus one per series for its
  // latest value (~1.3K descents, ~20ms), which is what makes the cache-cold
  // `/api/groups` render fast.
  //
  // Three non-obvious constructions keep every probe a pure index descent:
  //
  //  - The successor probe cannot be a single row comparison
  //    `(query_idx, engine, format) > (...)`: a row comparison is only a btree
  //    index qual when its first column is the index's FIRST column, and these
  //    are index columns 5-7 (the planner degrades the row form to a filter over
  //    a full scan). It is instead three single-column-inequality branches (next
  //    format within the series' query_idx+engine, then next engine within its
  //    query_idx, then next query_idx), each fully index-sargable. The branches
  //    partition the tuples greater than the current series (every qualifying
  //    row satisfies exactly one branch, and all of branch N's rows precede all
  //    of branch N+1's rows in tuple order), so the successor is the row from
  //    the lowest-numbered non-empty branch. Each branch carries a constant
  //    `br` ordinal and the union is selected via `ORDER BY br LIMIT 1`, which
  //    makes that choice a SQL-guaranteed ordering rather than a reliance on
  //    Append evaluating `UNION ALL` arms in syntactic order (which Postgres
  //    does today but does not document). The ordinal sort costs at most one
  //    extra single-row descent per branch per step (~1.5x measured), not the
  //    full-scan cliff the skip scan exists to avoid.
  //
  //  - Every probe's ORDER BY spells out the full index prefix (dataset,
  //    dataset_variant, scale_factor, storage, ...) even though those columns
  //    are pinned by the WHERE. An `IS NULL` pin (NULL-variant/scale groups)
  //    does not join the planner's equivalence classes, so with the short
  //    `ORDER BY query_idx, engine, format` form the planner cannot prove the
  //    index already provides the order and inserts a Sort over the whole
  //    group. The pinned columns are constant per group, so the long form is
  //    semantically identical.
  //
  //  - "Latest" must order `commit_timestamp DESC NULLS LAST` (a transient NULL
  //    -- a row from a writer not yet populating `commit_timestamp`, before the
  //    post-deploy re-backfill -- must not win over real timestamps), but the
  //    index is `commit_timestamp DESC`, i.e. NULLS FIRST, so that order is not
  //    index-provided. The per-series latest probe therefore takes the newest
  //    `commit_timestamp IS NOT NULL` row first (index-ordered descent past the
  //    NULL block, ordinal 1) and falls back to the NULL-timestamp rows
  //    (ordinal 2) only when the series has no timestamped rows; the two
  //    branches are selected via the same `ORDER BY br LIMIT 1` guarantee as
  //    the successor probe. The fallback branch joins `commits` and orders by
  //    `c.timestamp DESC NULLS LAST` so an all-unstamped series (one ingested
  //    entirely inside the transient window) still returns its NEWEST value,
  //    matching the replaced join-ordered query, rather than an arbitrary row.
  //    The join is LEFT so an orphan row whose commit_sha has no commits row
  //    -- impossible unless a writer violates the commits-upsert-first
  //    invariant -- still surfaces (last) instead of vanishing as it did under
  //    the old INNER JOIN; fail-visible is preferred. The fallback's join cost
  //    is irrelevant: it executes only for series with zero stamped rows.
  //
  // The `value_ns > 0` filter rides inside every probe: it is read from the
  // index leaf (INCLUDE), so the enumeration lands directly on series that have
  // at least one valid row, the same set `DISTINCT ON` produced. The timestamp
  // value is the same `commits.timestamp` the original join used, so the
  // same-second-tie behavior (an accepted tradeoff) is unchanged. `$1` =
  // dataset, `$2` = storage; variant/scale params append only when non-null.
