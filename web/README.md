# Benchmarks web (v4 read service)

Next.js 15 (App Router) read service serving the benchmark charts at
[bench.vortex.dev](https://bench.vortex.dev) from the benchmarks Postgres database. This is the
v4 frontend that replaced both the v2 Vite/React SPA and the v3 Axum server — see
[`../docs/legacy.md`](../docs/legacy.md).

## Local development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev          # needs BENCH_DB_* pointing at a database (see below)

pnpm format:check # prettier
pnpm lint         # eslint
pnpm build        # next build; deliberately works WITHOUT a database
pnpm test         # vitest; the Postgres integration suite needs Docker and uv
```

`next build` never touches the database: every page and route is request-rendered
(`force-dynamic` or request-URL-dependent), so builds are reproducible with no `BENCH_DB_*`
configured. Keep it that way; the CI `test` job builds with no database on purpose.

## Database environment

Connection config is read by `lib/db.ts`:

| Variable                        | Required           | Meaning                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `BENCH_DB_HOST`                 | yes                | Postgres host.                                                                                                                                |
| `BENCH_DB_NAME`                 | yes                | Database name.                                                                                                                                |
| `BENCH_DB_USER`                 | yes                | Role to connect as.                                                                                                                           |
| `BENCH_DB_PORT`                 | no (5432)          | Port.                                                                                                                                         |
| `BENCH_DB_PASSWORD`             | no                 | Static password. When unset, each new connection authenticates with a freshly minted RDS IAM token instead.                                   |
| `BENCH_DB_REGION`               | for IAM            | AWS region for the RDS IAM signer; required when no password is set. IAM token signing also needs AWS credentials in the runtime environment. |
| `BENCH_DB_SSL`                  | no (`verify-full`) | `verify-full` validates the certificate chain and hostname; `disable` is for local non-TLS containers only. Any other value fails loudly.     |
| `BENCH_DB_CA`                   | prod               | PEM contents of the Amazon RDS CA bundle; Node's trust store does not include the RDS roots, so `verify-full` against RDS fails without it.   |
| `BENCH_DB_POOL_MAX`             | no (8)             | Max pool connections per serverless instance; the per-render summary fan-out (`SUMMARY_CONCURRENCY`) is sized to this default.                |
| `BENCH_DB_STATEMENT_TIMEOUT_MS` | no (30000)         | PostgreSQL server-side timeout for each web statement. `0` disables the timeout.                                                              |

## CDN caching

The read paths serve traffic through Vercel's CDN with a five-minute fresh window, matching
the v2 site's S3 refresh cadence, plus bounded stale-while-revalidate windows for low-traffic
warmth:

- The data routes (`/api/groups`, `/api/group/*`, `/api/chart/*`) set
  `Cache-Control: public, s-maxage=300, stale-while-revalidate=3600` on success responses
  (`lib/cache.ts`); error responses omit the header so they are never CDN-cached. `/api/health`
  is deliberately uncached so the liveness probe always reflects the live database.
- The HTML pages (`/` and `/chart/:slug`) cannot set response headers from a server component,
  and Next.js emits `Cache-Control: no-store` for `force-dynamic` pages, which takes precedence
  over config-file `Cache-Control` rules. Instead, `vercel.json` sets `Vercel-CDN-Cache-Control`
  on those routes: that header is consumed (and stripped) by Vercel's CDN alone at the highest
  precedence, so the CDN caches the rendered pages while browsers still revalidate every load.

The deploy workflow verifies the expected build SHA through `/api/health`, a representative group
and chart JSON response, the landing and chart pages, and a CDN `HIT` on repeated landing/chart-API
requests. The probe has a three-minute deadline. Production uses the public `BENCH_SITE_BASE_URL`
and fails verification on authentication errors or redirects. A protected preview reports
verification as blocked, with no claim that its health, build identity, or caching passed.

One deliberate
divergence from the API routes: the `vercel.json` header rules apply to every response status,
so an unknown `/chart/:slug` 404 follows the HTML page rule: five minutes fresh and then eligible
for Vercel's one-day stale-while-revalidate window. That is acceptable for opaque, never-linked
malformed/unknown chart URLs, while real chart pages refresh on the same five-minute fresh cadence
as the landing page (transient 5xx responses are believed not CDN-cacheable by Vercel; if one ever
were, the same HTML page rule would bound it).

## Deploys

`.github/workflows/web-ci.yml` and the deploy workflow run the same `web-checks` composite action:
format, lint, build without database credentials, and tests with Docker. The standalone required
check remains `format, lint, build, test`. A deployment waits for its own check job, then checks
out and builds that exact `github.sha`. PRs use the event's merge commit, including stacked PRs
whose base is another branch. Fork PRs run correctness CI but do not receive deployment credentials.

Pushes to `develop` deploy production. Manual production runs are limited to `develop`.
Both triggers share one production queue and let an active deploy finish verification.
New preview runs can cancel older previews of the same event and ref.
Same-repository PRs touching the app, migrations, scripts, or check/deploy tooling produce previews.
The Vercel CLI builds on the runner and uploads the prebuilt output. `BENCH_BUILD_SHA` is embedded
in that output so the uncached health endpoint identifies the checked-out build.

One-time operator setup:

1. Create the Vercel project: Framework Next.js, **Root Directory `web/`**,
   and the GitHub integration **disabled** (deploys are CLI-driven from CI; the integration
   would double-deploy).
2. Set the GitHub repo secret `VERCEL_TOKEN` (a Vercel deploy token) and repo variables
   `VERCEL_ORG_ID` + `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` (from the Vercel project settings). Set the
   repo variable `BENCH_SITE_BASE_URL` to the public production URL as `https://<domain>`.
   The existing keep-warm workflow uses the same variable. Production deployment requires it
   before uploading and verifies the public domain after deployment.
3. Configure `BENCH_DB_*` on the Vercel project (Production and Preview environments). Two open
   wiring choices are deliberately left to this step, per environment:
   - **Endpoint**: the RDS Proxy (`vortex-bench-proxy.proxy-*.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com`) is
     VPC-internal, so plain Vercel functions cannot reach it; without VPC connectivity for the
     Vercel project, use the public RDS instance endpoint (the same endpoint CI writers use).
   - **Auth**: a static `BENCH_DB_PASSWORD` for the read-only `bench_read` role. This is the
     currently supported mode: migration `005_read_role.sql` creates `bench_read` with **NO
     `rds_iam` grant** (and idempotently revokes it if a pre-existing role carries it), because
     on RDS `rds_iam` membership forces IAM-only auth and the Vercel runtime has no AWS
     credentials to mint IAM tokens. IAM auth is therefore **not available for `bench_read` as
     shipped**: enabling it would require BOTH a follow-up migration granting `rds_iam` to a
     read role (which atomically disables that role's password auth) AND AWS credentials in the
     function runtime (for example Vercel's OIDC federation to an AWS role with
     `rds-db:connect`).
